Astryx v0.7.13 · 174 components
CLI: run every command as `npx astryx <cmd>` (shown below as `astryx ...`).

SETUP (once, in app entry e.g. main.tsx) — without these, components render unstyled:
  import "@astryxdesign/core/reset.css";
  import "@astryxdesign/core/astryx.css";

WORKFLOW — start every page from a template, never from scratch:
1. `astryx build "<idea>"` — names the template to scaffold from and the parts it lacks.
2. `astryx template <name> <path>` — scaffold it; keep its frame, gap and padding; replace the content.
3. `astryx template <Block>` for parts it lacks; `astryx component <Name>` to read props before using one.
Changing an existing page? Keep it: skip step 2 and add blocks/components inside its sections.
Before you deliver a build, run `astryx doctor --built <dir>`; don't deliver it if it fails.

RULES:
- No <div> — components handle all layout and spacing.
- Read `astryx docs layout` before changing a template's frame.
- Dense data = rows (Table, List/Item), not Card-wrapped lists. Badge = counts only.
- Style with component props first, then tokens (var(--color-*|--spacing-*|--radius-*)). No raw hex/px. No StyleX/Tailwind compiler here — don't use xstyle/utility classes directly. Some templates use StyleX and need a compiler plugin; see `astryx docs styling-overview`.
- Palettes and custom colors go through the theme, never :root overrides. Run `astryx theme add <slug>` to import; `theme eject <slug>` only forks source. See `astryx docs theme`.
- SELF-CHECK: re-read the file; replace any raw <div>/<span>, imported .css/@apply, or hardcoded #hex/px with the component or a token.

`astryx help` lists every command. Key ones beyond the workflow:
  search "<query>"   find any component / hook / doc / template
  discover <words>   integrations you could add
  docs <topic>       getting-started, principles, tokens, theme … (`astryx docs` lists all)
  docs cli           commands and API reference
  docs authoring     build an integration package, and every field it holds
  upgrade --from <old version> --apply   run after a dependency bump

## Tanpopo Cold-Start Agent Navigation & Governance Gate (Gate G4 Stage 2 Approved)

If you are starting a fresh session with no prior chat context (e.g., executing a `TP-IMP-xxxx` unit):
1. **Read [`docs/governance/execution-baseline.md`](./docs/governance/execution-baseline.md) FIRST** (`EXEC-BL-001-APPROVED`).
   - Current Delivery Handoff Verdict: **`GO`** (`Milestone M0` units `TP-IMP-0001..0004` = `DONE`; **solely [`TP-IMP-0005`](./docs/planning/units/TP-IMP-0005.md) is `READY`** under Owner approval `DEC-010`; `TP-IMP-0006..0047` remain `BLOCKED` behind their upstream `Dependencies`, `REQUIRES_STRONG_REVIEW`, and `COND-PO-01..05` gates).
   - Execute **only** a unit explicitly marked **`READY`** in [`docs/planning/implementation-index.md`](./docs/planning/implementation-index.md); never self-accept units on the Product Owner's behalf and never tag/publish releases (`GATE-REL-07`).
2. **Master Unit Index & Specs:** [`docs/planning/implementation-index.md`](./docs/planning/implementation-index.md) → `docs/planning/units/TP-IMP-xxxx.md`.
3. **Contracts & Spike Evidence (`M0`):** [`proto/tanpopo/extension/v1/runtime.proto`](./proto/tanpopo/extension/v1/runtime.proto), [`openapi/`](./openapi), [`db/spec-check/`](./db/spec-check), and [`docs/architecture/spike-results.md`](./docs/architecture/spike-results.md).
4. **Audit, Gap & Documentation Hubs:** [`docs/reviews/execution-readiness.md`](./docs/reviews/execution-readiness.md), [`docs/reviews/unresolved-gaps.md`](./docs/reviews/unresolved-gaps.md), [`README.md`](./README.md) & [`docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md).
